                <p> Quarter 2 IPBA: Think and make atleast three or more brain storming techniques <br> for your chosen problem about gender based violence. The chosen problem of<br> this group is "wife selling."</p>
                <h1 style="color:#164863;">Wife-selling</h1>
                <p>Wife-seling is an act that involves a husband auctioning off and selling their wives<br> for not only money, but also as a way of divorve between the seller-husband and<br> the wife. The buyer on the other hand automatically gets married to the wife that<br> is being sold. This was a popular method of self divorce and self marriage during<br> the 17th century at England. </p>

                <h1 style="color: #164863;">CSS</h1>
                <p>CSS is a coding languange that can be used to design webpages like this for a more<br> organized and cleaner look.</p>
                <p>For this webpage, my group chose to use CSS to design the background color of this<br> webpage and also to make individual tabs for each brainstorming technique in order<br> to be more organized and also allowing it to be accessed and browsed through easily.</p>

                <p>The first brain storming technique that my group worked on is mind mapping. We<br> stated the problem and how it was affecting the women of that generartion while<br> also showing how to was connected it gender based violence. We thought of<br> possible realistic solutions  that could've helped or made an impact during that<br> century.</p>

                <h1 style="color:#164863;" style="text-align:center;">5 Whys</h1>
                <p>One of the brain storming technique that my group also used is 5 whys. <br>These 5 questions helped us find the root cause of our chosen problem,<br> making it easier for us to find effective solutions.</p>

            <div class="season_content">
                <h1 style="color:#164863;"style="text-align:center;">Fishbone Diagram</h1>
                <p>The fishbone diagram is quite different from the 1st two. Unlike mind mapping<br> that helped us find which solution might be best, or the 5 whys that served as<br> a way to peel away the problem to find the root cause, the fishbone diagram<br> serves as more of a cause and effect technique.</p>
                <p>Starting from the first fish bone (the one near the tail at the very end), it states <br> causes connected to financial problems. The middle bone states problems <br> about marriage that led to the effect, while the bone nearest to the head (the<br> effect) are causes connected to divorce.</p>

                <p>For the starbursting technique, it included getting asked six questions.</p>
                <p>- When? <br>- How? <br>- Why? <br>- Where? <br>- What? <br>- Who? </p>
                <p>Answering these six questions can help us get more familiarized with<br> our chosen problem.</p>

            <h1 style="color:#164863;" style="text-align: center;">Solutions</h1>
            <p>After using various brain storming methods, my group has come up with<br> possible solutions that couldve made crucial impacts to our chosen issue.</p>
            <h1 style="color:#164863;">Education</h1>
            <p>We can all agree that education is one of the most important and crucial <br>factors that shapes us up, making us what we are now. Because of the <br>patriarcy and multiple misogynistic gender stereotypes during the 17th<br> century, women did not have any proper access to education.</p>
            <h1 style="color: #164863;">Empowerment</h1>
            <p>Without the rights to education, empowerment and independence played <br>a crucial role during the 17th century to these women in order to survive. <br> Showing support can lead to encouragement and empowerment to one <br>another.</p>
            <h1 style="color:#164863;">Spreading information</h1>
            <p>Women bringing awareness to eachouther about the dehumanizing truth <br> about wife selling. Making the government hear women's voices is a good<br> way to make them acknowledge their discrimination against women and for <br> the government to start having laws to protect women. Fighting for their <br> rights can show that women are more capable than the mindset everyone <br>had towards them. Having access to education without discrimination, can<br> lead to empowered women and people who can solve the problems of<br> their marriage without having to sell anyone. Making people aware with<br> being human and leading them to disagreeing with selling people, will <br>decrease the acts of wife-selling and the support for it.</p>
            <h1 style="color:#164863;">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>With all those facts stated above, me and my group came to conclusion <br> and picked out a solution from the mind map. Our chosen solutino is:<br> "Challenge/debate their ideas and stereotypes about women by protesting <br> about the ethics of wife-selling and flaws". We all decided that this would<br> be the best, most impactful and realistic solution that couldve helped<br> solving our chosen problem. Even though the other solutions stated on <br>the mind map wouldve also helped with putting a halt to wife selling, <br> not all of them are exactly realistic and applicable to the timeline <br> where our problem happened. Our group made sure to apply all the <br>possible solutions in the timeline, and came to conclusion that our<br> chosen one would be the best to not only raise awareness, but also <br>let peoples voices be heard.</p>
